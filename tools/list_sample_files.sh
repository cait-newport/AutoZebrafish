# list_sample_files.sh
# Description: This script defines a function that generates a list of a specified percentage of the files from each folder within a specified directory.
# The list is saved in a text file, with each entry containing the folder and file path. These files can then be used to set up the 
# LISA annotation tool (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/app/lisa/lisa.html).

#
# Usage:
# 1. Save this script to a file, e.g., list_sample_files.sh.
# 2. Make the script executable: chmod +x list_sample_files.sh.
# 3. Run the script with the directory path and percentage as arguments: ./list_sample_files.sh "/path/to/directory" percentage.
#    Alternatively, you can call the function directly within another script.
#
# Example:
#   ./list_sample_files.sh "/path/to/directory" 10
#
# Function:
# - list_sample_files(directory, percentage):
#   Takes a directory and percentage as arguments, lists all folders in that directory, and creates a list of the specified percentage of the files in each folder.
#   The list is saved to a text file named "sample_files_list.txt", with each folder and file path on its own line.
#   The function saves the file list in the current working directory.
#
# Dependencies:
# - The script uses basic Unix commands such as ls, sort, and standard file operations.
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure that the specified directory exists and contains subfolders with files.
# - The output file (sample_files_list.txt) will be created or overwritten in the current working directory.
